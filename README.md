# NYC Taxi Data Analysis Project

## Overview
Thanks for viewing my NYC Taxi Data Analysis Project. As part of my Google data analysis course, I undertook an in-depth exploration of New York City's taxi service data provided by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. This project aims to uncover insights into taxi usage patterns, fare distributions, and tipping behavior across different payment methods and passenger counts.

## Data
The dataset has records of yellow taxi trips in New York City for the year 2017. It includes various attributes such as pickup and drop-off dates/times, trip distances, fare amounts, tip amounts, and payment types.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: To organize and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and creating an interactive dashboard.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Importing the taxi trip data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing or anomalous data entries.
3. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing trip distances and total amounts to identify outliers and trends.
4. **Payment Analysis**: Investigating the distribution and average amounts of different payment types.
5. **Tipping Behavior Analysis**: Calculating the average tip amount by payment type and by passenger count for credit card payments.
6. **Vendor Comparison**: Counting trip occurrences and comparing the average and most common fare amounts by vendor ID.

## Findings
- Credit card payments were the most frequent, with an average tip amount of $2.73.
- Passenger count showed no significant influence on the average tip amount for credit card payments.
- Vendor 2 had a higher presence in the data compared to Vendor 1, with similar average fare amounts.

## Conclusion
This project offered valuable insights into the taxi industry in New York City, shedding light on operational aspects and customer behavior. It provided an opportunity to apply data analysis techniques to a real-world dataset and communicate findings effectively through visualizations.

Thank you for checking out my project!
